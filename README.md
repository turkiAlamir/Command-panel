# Command-panel
this program makes a page with 5 buttons "forward-backward-right-left-stop"
each button has a character value assigned to it and by the press of the button the value is sent to a php code
the php code then connects to database with the name "robothistory" and then stores the value in table "commands" which have an auto increment primary key and auto regester date and time with a command which is where the value will be stored
lastly all the "commands" table's values will be displayed in the text box as "command history"
